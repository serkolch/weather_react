# It's a Zoo Out There

Let's get some more SQL Practice before jumping into incorporating SQL into our full-stack applications!

[SQL Zoo](http://sqlzoo.net/) is a great resource! I know everyone loves interactive / gamified platforms that making learning easier, so let's take some time to work through it.

## Setup

There are some quizzes and other resources at [SQL Zoo](http://sqlzoo.net/) at the left-bar - work through these!

## Completion

There is no pull request to perform here. You are responsible for working through as much as you can on your own. The more comfortable you are with SQL before we move onto implementing SQL into Node, the easier the transition will be! Don't let it snowball on you!

When working through a few of the options, I managed to complete:
* SELECT basics
* quiz
* SELECT from world
* quiz

There were a few that I was unable to complete from memory and needed help from notes and Google, so don't feel discouraged by anything you see!

Aim to work through the resources for at least two hours! If it starts to feel too repetitive, that's good! That shows you're starting to get pattern recognition, which will soon turn into understanding.
